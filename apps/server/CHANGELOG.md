# csuite-server

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/pull/19) [`385ffef`](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/commit/385ffef84df773e09c8c6a736bfceccb1fa3fbf2) Thanks [@andrew-jon-p7a](https://github.com/andrew-jon-p7a)! - Fresh bootstraps now seed into a dedicated `./csuite/` server directory instead of scattering files across the cwd.

  `csuite setup` and the `csuite serve` first-run wizard create `./csuite/` (mode `0o700` — the containing-directory permission the KEK docs always recommended) and place `csuite.json`, `csuite.db`, and `csuite-kek.bin` inside it. Resolution never nests and stays backward compatible: an explicit `--config-path`/`$CSUITE_CONFIG_PATH` wins, a flat `./csuite.json` in the cwd marks it as the server directory (existing deployments and running from inside `./csuite/` both keep working unchanged), and `csuite serve` from the parent auto-discovers `./csuite/csuite.json`.

  Also fixed: a boot that bails before the wizard can run (non-TTY stdin, already-populated team) no longer leaves a freshly-minted `csuite-kek.bin` — or anything else — behind in the directory.

- [#19](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/pull/19) [`9199dba`](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/commit/9199dbafaa3337a9d62c7fd287ae666d90fb4f05) Thanks [@andrew-jon-p7a](https://github.com/andrew-jon-p7a)! - Retire the team `directive` field and slim the first-run wizard to identity + auth.

  The wizard now collects only the team name, your name, a bearer token, and TOTP enrollment — no more forced directive/context/role prose before you've even seen the product. Standing context lives in exactly three editable places: `team.context` (team-level, now up to 8192 chars, editable from TeamHome in the web UI, `csuite team set`, or the `team_update` MCP tool), role title + description (public per-member), and member `instructions` (private per-member).

  Existing databases migrate automatically on boot: a non-empty legacy `directive` is folded into the head of `context` and the column is dropped. `PATCH /team`, `csuite team set`, and `team_update` no longer accept `directive`.

### Patch Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/pull/22) [`871122f`](https://github.com/the-efficacious/commandsuite/commit/871122fdab0bfbf5ed3507dc8392903b5ecb9be4) Thanks [@andrew-jon-p7a](https://github.com/andrew-jon-p7a)! - `csuite-web-ui` and `csuite-web-host` are now published packages (previously private workspace packages), and both join the fixed version group so the whole published surface releases in lockstep.

  - **`csuite-web-ui`** ships as it always existed internally: TypeScript source (`files: ["src"]`, exports pointing at `src/index.ts`). Build it with your host's bundler — Vite + `@preact/preset-vite` is the reference setup (`csuite-web-host` is the working example). Mount the team view via `<TeamShell>`.
  - **`csuite-web-host`** now builds into its own `dist/` and publishes it (`files: ["dist"]`), so an external host — a managed service, a CDN, any static server — can serve the same TOTP-gated PWA the self-hosted broker ships, straight from the tarball (`csuite-web-host/dist`).
  - **`csuite-server`** owns the copy step now: its build syncs `csuite-web-host/dist` into `public/` (`apps/server/scripts/sync-public.mjs`) instead of web-host writing into the server's tree. No behavior change for server users — the published tarball still ships the built PWA in `public/`.
